# Ethiopia Financial Inclusion Analysis

This project analyzes Ethiopia’s digital financial landscape, providing a **data enrichment pipeline, exploratory analysis, and visualizations** to support decision-making and policy design for financial inclusion.

---

## 🏗 Project Overview

Ethiopia is undergoing rapid digital financial transformation, with mobile money platforms, internet penetration, and agent networks driving financial inclusion. This project tracks these changes by:

1. **Enriching datasets** – Integrating new observations, regulatory events, and impact links.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Summarizing trends, gaps, and correlations in financial access and usage.
3. **Visualization & Insights** – Generating figures and insights for stakeholders.

The workflow combines **data engineering, statistical analysis, and visualization** to create actionable intelligence.

## ⚡ Requirements

* Python ≥ 3.10
* Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `pytest`
* Jupyter Notebook for interactive exploration

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🛠 Setup & Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone <repo_url>
cd <project_root>
```

2. **Prepare raw data**

   * Place `ethiopia_fi_unified_data.csv` and `reference_codes.csv` in `data/raw/`.

3. **Run the Data Enrichment Pipeline**

```python
from src.data_enrichment import FinancialInclusionDataEnricher
enricher = FinancialInclusionDataEnricher(
    data_path="data/raw/ethiopia_fi_unified_data.csv",
    reference_path="data/raw/reference_codes.csv"
)
enricher.run_full_task1()
```

4. **Perform Exploratory Data Analysis**

```python
from src.eda import EthiopiaFinancialInclusionEDA
eda = EthiopiaFinancialInclusionEDA(
    data_path="data/processed/ethiopia_fi_enriched.csv",
    output_dir="reports/figures/eda"
)
eda.summarize_dataset()
eda.plot_account_ownership()
eda.plot_usage_trends(["ACC_OWNERSHIP","USG_P2P_COUNT"])
eda.plot_correlation(["ACC_OWNERSHIP","ACC_MM_ACCOUNT","USG_P2P_COUNT"])
```

5. **Explore Notebooks**

   * `notebooks/data_enrichment_exploration.ipynb`
   * `notebooks/eda.ipynb`

---

## 📊 Workflow Overview

### 1. Data Enrichment (Task 1)

* Load raw dataset and reference codes
* Validate dataset schema
* Add new **observations** (smartphone penetration, internet usage, etc.)
* Add new **events** (regulations, policy changes)
* Add **impact links** between events and indicators
* Save enriched dataset and enrichment log

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (Task 2)

* Dataset overview and quality assessment
* Temporal coverage & gaps
* Pillar-based distribution and access analysis
* Usage, infrastructure, and event trend visualization
* Correlation analysis & key insights
* Identify sparse or new indicators

---

## 📝 Outputs

* **Enriched Dataset:** `data/processed/ethiopia_fi_enriched.csv`
* **Data Enrichment Log:** `data/processed/data_enrichment_log.md`
* **Visualizations:** `reports/figures/`

  * Enablers vs outcomes
  * Indicator coverage
  * Event timelines
  * Infrastructure trends
  * Correlation heatmaps
* **Insights:** Key findings on account ownership growth, mobile money adoption gaps, P2P growth, and infrastructure enablement

---

## ✅ Testing

Unit tests ensure reliability of enrichment and EDA pipelines.

Run all tests with:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

---

## 🔹 Key Insights

* **Account Ownership** is increasing, though growth is decelerating.
* **Mobile Money Gap** persists, highlighting potential for digital financial expansion.
* **Digital Transactions** (P2P) are growing rapidly.
* **Infrastructure** such as 4G coverage is limited; more investment is needed.
* **Data Quality** is mostly high confidence but has gaps for some indicators; results should be interpreted cautiously.

---

## ⚙️ Notes

* All analysis is reproducible using the provided notebooks and scripts.
* Future work: include new indicators, improve temporal coverage, and expand event-impact modeling.
